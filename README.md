# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the analysis: 
The objective of the analysis was to create a Pandas DataFrame to create a ride-sharing summary by city type. Using the Data Frame along with pivot and resample functions, create a multiple line graph that shows total fares for each week by city type.  

## Results: 
As you can see from the below line chart, based on city type the fares increase on a weekly basis. Urban city has the highest fare and the Rural city has the lowest.

- The below data frame summary showcases in the first glance itself that Urban driver's average fare is the lowest whereas the Rural driver's fare is the highest. This is because the number of drivers are the least in the Rural city. 
- In addition to above, the rural city has also the least number of rides and total fares. 
- Since the avaerage fare per driver is the highest in Rural city, so is the Average fare per ride. This indicates that taking a PyBer ride in rural cities are costly and cheap in Urban city.

## Summary: 
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
- Increase the fare in Urban city setup as the drivers earn really less and rides in cities are shorter
- Based on demand, move the drivers around between city types
- Use variable pricing based on demand
